##Refactoring Legacy Applications with React Testing Library

###Objectives

1. Learn how to update production packages while using React Testing Lirbary.
2. Learn to convert test from Enzyme or ReactTestUtils to React Testing Library.

For the excercises on this topic you will find two repositories on each file, the start-excercise and end-excercise.
On the start-excercise you will find a Readme file with the steps to complete the refactoring, but without the complete changes. The end-excercise will contain the files with refactoring changes applied, so you can compare your results.

All the excercises will be practice with a simple budgeting app.
  - A income, spending and left over ammounts.
  - Two buttons: 
    - Set Income: Opens a modal with an input to update the total income of the user and.
    - Create new budget: Open a modal with a category dropdown and an ammount input to set the budget ammount.
  - After adding a new budget, an associated bar graph and spending progress bar are added.
  - The user can add ammount to the spending progress or delete it by clicking the trash can.
